### Organization Team 

The following colleagues will serve on the organization committee

#### Ilknur Icke, PhD, Director of Applied Machine Learning, Bayer

[Ilknur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilknuricke/) is interested in the study of complex systems, at the intersection of sensing and computational
modeling for better understanding and interventions. Her prior experience includes active learning
based design of real-time fMRI experiments and computational modeling of such experiments to
study human brain. Ilknur has been in the pharmaceuticals R&D domain for almost a decade working
in highly interdisciplinary teams developing capabilities in such areas as modeling & simulation
tools for PK/PD analysis, molecular imaging applications for neuroscience and oncology, as well as
analysis of multi-omics data and generative modeling for de-novo compound design. She has run a
company-wide Quantum Computing focus group bringing together internal and external colleagues.
Ilknur also has been serving as a reviewer for the MICCAI conference.

#### Matteo Aldeghi, PhD, Director of Machine Learning Research, Bayer

[Matteo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matteoaldeghi/) is broadly interested in the development of computational approaches that can accelerate
pharmaceutical R&D, especially the application of machine learning to the design of new therapies,
from small-molecule drugs to biological therapies. He is also interested in leveraging large biological
datasets, like multi-omics data, to inform early therapeutic design decisions. Matteo has a expertise
in biophysical simulations for drug discovery and biomolecular design, structure-based drug design,
active learning applied to the chemical design, ML-guided experimental optimization, the development
of graph neural networks for molecular property predictions, as well as broad knowledge of
computational chemistry and cheminformatics. He was a reviewer for past NeurIPS workshops (e.g.
AI for Accelerated Materials Design) and a key/primary organizer of a structure-based drug design
workshop attended by approximately 120 academics and pharma industry professionals.


#### Ming Tommy Tang, PhD, Director of Computational Biology, Immunitas Therapeutics

[Ming 'Tommy' Tang](https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.com/) is the Director of Computational Biology at [Immunitas Therapeutics](https://www.immunitastx.com/). At Immunitas, they employ a single-cell sequencing platform to dissect the biology of immune cells in human tumors. They use machine learning approaches to study single-cell RNA, single-cell TCR, and spatial transcriptome data for new target discovery. He is a computational biologist with extensive experience in genomics, epigenomics, and (single-cell) transcriptomics data. He has over ten years of computational biology experience and six years of wet lab experience. He uses R primarily for data wrangling and visualization in the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) ecosystem; he uses Python for writing [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflows and reformatting data; he is a Unix geek learning shell tricks almost every month; he cares about reproducible research and open science. Prior to joining Immunitas, Tommy was at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard University, where he led a team to analyze immune-oncology-related single-cell sequencing datasets and spearheaded an NIH-funded project called Cancer Immunological Data Commons (CIDC).
